  description:
    In this paper, we presented single-cell combinatorial indexed Hi-C (sci-Hi-C), a
    high-throughput technique for studying chromosomal conformation in over 10,000 single
    mouse and human cells. We demonstrated that sci-Hi-C could deconvolute complex mixtures of
    cells harboring cell-type-specific karyotypic differences, and cells of the same type
    occupying different portions of the cell cycle.
