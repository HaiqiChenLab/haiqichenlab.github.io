  description:
    'Here, we presented MNase-seq by single-strand profiling (MNase-SSP), a generalizable library preparation
    protocol to sensitively profile the fragments resulting from nucleolytic digestion of chromatin. We demonstrate
    that MNase-SSP captures different classes of minimally protected CTCF/Ctcf fragments possibly indicative of differential
    finger usage, and reveals subnucleosomal structure at murine embryonic stem cell promoters.

- title: "Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in thousands of single cells"

  description:
    'Here we presented single-cell combinatorial indexing for measuring chromatin accessibility & RNA expression (sci-CAR), a high-throughput
    single-cell sequencing method for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression in thousands of single cells in a single
    experiment. We applied sci-CAR to A549 cells drugged with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone, as well as primary murine kidneys.
