#  image: /img/aim2.png
#  altimage: /img/aim2.png
#  description: 'Cellular and organismal functions in the contexts of development and disease
#    rely on the proper integration of extracellular signals into gene regulatory responses. We apply metabolic perturbation strategies to established cell culture
#    systems, and then model these perturbations using a diverse array of genomic techniques.
#    These methods include high-throughput single-cell sequencing techniques (*e.g.* sci-RNA-seq, sci-ATAC-seq),
#    which allow us to characterize cellular state changes, and high-throughput protein-DNA interaction mapping techniques (*e.g.* ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN),
#    which provide us with base-pair resolution maps of nucleosome-DNA and transcription factor-DNA interactions.
