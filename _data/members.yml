#   description: "I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in the year of 2018 with B.S.degree in Biochemistry. Prior to my graduation, I participated in both biomedical engineering and organic chemistry laboratory settings. With the objective to study the proteolytic network between cathepsin proteases and extracellular matrix in malignant tumors, my role in the bioengineering laboratory was to optimize and execute experimental methods from literature reviews, to purify and activate precursor-cathepsins from transfected HEK 293T cells. Secondly, for my initial undergraduate project, I synthesized HDAC inhibitors to determine their optimal antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cell lines. Afterwards, I joined the University of California, San Francisco and facilitated a study that focused on whether cellular matrix dimensionality intrinsically affects cell behaviors that predispose to cell dormancy.

#   Having committed in different research settings and conferences at both Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of California, San Francisco, I have found that I take inspiration in understanding of human diseases in a genomic level through experimental and computational methods. I am very much excited to join the Ramani Lab, where I can contribute through applying my experimental knowledge and enhance my background on genetics and bioinformatics."

#  description: "I graduated from Pomona College in 2017, with a B.A in Molecular Biology and a minor in mathematics. As a Beckman Scholar, I worked with Matt Sazinsky on engineering novel proteins capable of hydroxylating straight-chain and cyclic carbon compounds. I spent my junior year as a research associate working in the lab of David Lomas at University College London, which inspired me to pursue graduate study in the UK. I subsequently completed a masters in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge in 2018, working with Serena Nik-Zainal to study tumorigenesis through the lens of mutational signatures. While there, I helped develop new statistical models for understanding how DNA damage and repair can shape the tumor genome - which led to a strong interest in how cancer evades and co-opts cellular machinery to survive.


#  I'm currently a 2nd year student in the Biological and Medical Informatics program, jointly advised between the Ramani Lab and the Goodarzi Lab. As I begin my thesis research, I'm excited to leverage both experimental and computational approaches towards mapping the genomic and epigenomic drivers of cancer metastasis."

I am very excited to be working with the Ramani Lab this summer as an introduction to research in the field of systems biology. In my time at the lab I will be focusing on their research about the regulation of tRNA genes, while gaining an exposure to machine learning and DNA sequencing."
