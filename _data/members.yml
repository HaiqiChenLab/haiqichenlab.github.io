  description: 'Haiqi is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He received a medical degree from China Medical University in 2013 and Ph.D. in Molecular Endocrinology from the University of Hong Kong in 2017. During his Ph.D., he also conducted research at the Population Council 
  at the Rockefeller University as a predoctoral fellow. In 2018, Haiqi began his postdoctoral training at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as a Lalor fellow, and later on started an independent research program at the Cecil H. and Ida 
  Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences at the UT Southwestern Medical Center in late 2021. In his free time, Haiqi enjoys Sci-Fi novels and soccer.

#   motivated me to pursue research in quantitative molecular biology.In February 2017 I began working as an undergraduate research assistant in Jay Shendure''s lab in the UW department of Genome Sciences. In Jay''s lab I worked closely with Jason Klein to research regulatory DNA in the context of evolution and disease. To do so, we used “Massively Parallel Reporter Assays” (MPRAs), a variation of traditional reporter assays that can test thousands of sequences for regulatory activity en masse by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a readout. Notably, we applied MPRAs to study the evolution of enhancers in primates, as well as to functionally characterize and prioritize GWAS SNPs that may be involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis. Since MPRAs often rely on testing short array-synthesized sequences, I also helped develop a protocol to assemble thousands of array oligos into longer sequences that are closer to the size of most predicted enhancers.

#  description: "I graduated from Wellesley College in 2014 where I studied Biology. Afterwards, I worked for several years in Vijay Sankaran's lab at Boston Children's Hospital / The Broad Institute, which studies hematopoiesis and how genetic variation alters blood cell production. I did research to understand mechanisms that lead to rare blood disorders, specifically using human pluripotent stem cells for disease modeling and investigated aberrant splicing mutations from patients with hematological disorders. In my main project, I explored how noncoding mutations disrupt the spliceosome and may lead to dyserythropoietic anemia. I am currently a 2nd-year PhD graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences program at UCSF. I rotated in the Ramani lab in Spring 2019, where I worked on methods for generating single-molecule and genome-wide maps of epigenetic modification. I look forward to starting my thesis research here, where I will develop high-throughput technologies to investigate how applied metabolic and genetic perturbations affect protein-DNA interactions and overall cellular-state changes."

#   description: "I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in the year of 2018 with B.S.degree in Biochemistry. Prior to my graduation, I participated in both biomedical engineering and organic chemistry laboratory settings. With the objective to study the proteolytic network between cathepsin proteases and extracellular matrix in malignant tumors, my role in the bioengineering laboratory was to optimize and execute experimental methods from literature reviews, to purify and activate precursor-cathepsins from transfected HEK 293T cells. Secondly, for my initial undergraduate project, I synthesized HDAC inhibitors to determine their optimal antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cell lines. Afterwards, I joined the University of California, San Francisco and facilitated a study that focused on whether cellular matrix dimensionality intrinsically affects cell behaviors that predispose to cell dormancy.

#   Having committed in different research settings and conferences at both Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of California, San Francisco, I have found that I take inspiration in understanding of human diseases in a genomic level through experimental and computational methods. I am very much excited to join the Ramani Lab, where I can contribute through applying my experimental knowledge and enhance my background on genetics and bioinformatics."

As a Beckman Scholar, I worked with Matt Sazinsky on engineering novel proteins capable of hydroxylating straight-chain and cyclic carbon compounds. I spent my junior year as a research associate working in the lab of David Lomas at University College London, which inspired me to pursue graduate study in the UK. I subsequently completed a masters in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge in 2018, working with Serena Nik-Zainal to study tumorigenesis through the lens of mutational signatures. While there, I helped develop new statistical models for understanding how DNA damage and repair can shape the tumor genome - which led to a strong interest in how cancer evades and co-opts cellular machinery to survive.


#  I'm currently a 2nd year student in the Biological and Medical Informatics program, jointly advised between the Ramani Lab and the Goodarzi Lab. As I begin my thesis research, I'm excited to leverage both experimental and computational approaches towards mapping the genomic and epigenomic drivers of cancer metastasis."
