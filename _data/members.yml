During her undergrad, she worked in the Ronald Breaker Lab to discover new structured noncoding RNAs in nature, and also with Hongyu Zhao to analyze polygenic and lifestyle risk for cardiovascular disease. After undergrad, she worked as a Software Engineer at Google. Dawn is interested in developing new molecular tools for cellular recording and molecular sensing. 
  She is currently collaborating with the lab on developing novel technologies to edit endogenous gene loci.

#  description: "I graduated from Pomona College in 2017, with a B.A in Molecular Biology and a minor in mathematics. As a Beckman Scholar, I worked with Matt Sazinsky on engineering novel proteins capable of hydroxylating straight-chain and cyclic carbon compounds. I spent my junior year as a research associate working in the lab of David Lomas at University College London, which inspired me to pursue graduate study in the UK. I subsequently completed a masters in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge in 2018, working with Serena Nik-Zainal to study tumorigenesis through the lens of mutational signatures. While there, I helped develop new statistical models for understanding how DNA damage and repair can shape the tumor genome - which led to a strong interest in how cancer evades and co-opts cellular machinery to survive.


#  I'm currently a 2nd year student in the Biological and Medical Informatics program, jointly advised between the Ramani Lab and the Goodarzi Lab. As I begin my thesis research, I'm excited to leverage both experimental and computational approaches towards mapping the genomic and epigenomic drivers of cancer metastasis."

I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Statistical Science. In the future, I hope to go to grad school to study Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I am very excited to be working with the Ramani Lab this summer as an introduction to research in the field of systems biology. In my time at the lab I will be focusing on their research about the regulation of tRNA genes, while gaining an exposure to machine learning and DNA sequencing."
