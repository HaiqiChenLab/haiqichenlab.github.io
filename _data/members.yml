  description: 'I finished my B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering at Princeton University, with minors in Quantitative & Compuational Biology, and Engineering Biology.
    While at Princeton, I studied in David Botstein''s [Integrated Science Curriculum](https://lsi.princeton.edu/integratedscience); this course sequence
    motivated me to pursue research in quantitative molecular biology.


    After finishing my undergraduate degree in 2012, I spent a year as a Research Intern / Computational Biologist working in the Bay Area at [Sangamo BioSciences](https://www.sangamo.com/) (now Sangamo Therapeutics). There,
    I worked closely with Jeff Miller and Ed Rebar to develop high-throughput sequencing assays to map potential off-target genomic sites for *de novo* engineered zinc finger and TALE nucleases. I then moved to Seattle, where I completed my Ph.D. in Genome Sciences in Jay Shendure''s lab
    at the University of Washington. In Jay''s lab, I developed new molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I first developed RNA Proximity Ligation, a high-throughput method
    to resolve RNA structures transcriptome-wide using proximity ligation and sequencing. I then worked with Andrew Adey, Junyue Cao, Darren Cusanovich, Zhijun Duan, and a bunch of other incredibly talented scientists in our lab and at Illumina
    to co-develop single-cell combinatorial indexing ("sci" sequencing), a methodological approach for molecularly characterizing thousands of single-cells without ever resorting to single-cell isolation. As a graduate student I also developed an interest in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation; I worked closely with Christine Disteche''s lab to apply novel
    bulk- and single-cell sequencing technologies to dissect the dynamics underlying mammalian X chromosome inactivation, wherein one entire X chromosome is heterochromatinized during early female mammalian development.


    In the Fall of 2018, I will be starting my own group at UC San Francisco. Our overarching goal is to continue developing novel molecular methods to study gene regulatory phenomena across the central dogma.
