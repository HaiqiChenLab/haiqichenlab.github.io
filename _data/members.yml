  description: 'I finished my B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering at Princeton University, with minors in Quantitative & Compuational Biology, and Engineering Biology.
    While at Princeton, I studied in David Botstein''s [Integrated Science Curriculum](https://lsi.princeton.edu/integratedscience); this course sequence
    motivated me to pursue research in quantitative molecular biology.


    After finishing my undergraduate degree in 2012, I spent a year as a Research Intern / Computational Biologist working in the Bay Area at [Sangamo BioSciences](https://www.sangamo.com/) (now Sangamo Therapeutics). There,
    I worked closely with Jeff Miller and Ed Rebar to develop high-throughput sequencing assays to map potential off-target genomic sites for *de novo* engineered zinc finger and TALE nucleases. I then moved to Seattle, where I completed my Ph.D. in Genome Sciences in Jay Shendure''s lab
    at the University of Washington. In Jay''s lab, I developed new molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I first developed RNA Proximity Ligation, a high-throughput method
    to resolve RNA structures transcriptome-wide using proximity ligation and sequencing. I then worked with Andrew Adey, Junyue Cao, Darren Cusanovich, Zhijun Duan, and a bunch of other incredibly talented scientists in our lab and at Illumina
    to co-develop single-cell combinatorial indexing ("sci" sequencing), a methodological approach for molecularly characterizing thousands of single-cells without ever resorting to single-cell isolation. As a graduate student I also developed an interest in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation; I worked closely with Christine Disteche''s lab to apply novel
    bulk- and single-cell sequencing technologies to dissect the dynamics underlying mammalian X chromosome inactivation, wherein one entire X chromosome is heterochromatinized during early female mammalian development.


    In the Fall of 2018, I will be starting my own group at UC San Francisco. Our overarching goal is to continue developing novel molecular methods to study gene regulatory phenomena across the central dogma.

  description: "I recently finished my B.S. degree in Biology at the University of Washington. In February 2017 I began working as an undergraduate research assistant in Jay Shendure’s lab in the UW’s department of Genome Sciences. In Jay’s lab I worked closely with Jason Klein to research regulatory DNA in the context of evolution and disease. To do so, we used “Massively Parallel Reporter Assays” (MPRAs), a variation of traditional reporter assays that can test thousands of sequences for regulatory activity en masse by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a readout. Notably, we applied MPRAs to study the evolution of enhancers in primates, as well as to functionally characterize and prioritize GWAS SNPs that may be involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis. Since MPRAs often rely on testing short array-synthesized sequences, I also helped develop a protocol to assemble thousands of array oligos into longer sequences that are closer to the size of most predicted enhancers.


  I am very excited to be joining the Ramani lab, where I will get to continue studying gene regulation by implementing and developing new ~omics techniques.
