Xin received his Ph.D. in Reproductive Medicine from the State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine in Nanjing Medical University. During his Ph.D., he focused on understanding the genetic causes of azoospermia. He studied the ultrastructure of sperm flagella and identified key genes and their roles in the motion of flagella. Xin has ample experience generating genetic animal models using CRISPR-based gene editing tools.  
  
  
  Xin is currently interested in dissecting gene functions at scale by combining CRISPR screen with spatial -omics technologies.
