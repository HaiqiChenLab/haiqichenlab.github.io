  description: "I finished my B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering at Princeton University, with minors in Quantitative Biology and Engineering Biology
    While at Princeton, I took part in David Botstein's [Integrated Science Curriculum]{https://lsi.princeton.edu/integratedscience}; this course sequence played a huge part in
    motivating me to pursue research in quantitative molecular biology.

    After finishing my undergraduate degree in 2012, I spent a year as a Research Intern / Computational Biologist working in the Bay Area at [Sangamo BioSciences]{https://www.sangamo.com/} (now Sangamo Therapeutics). There,
    I worked closely with Jeff Miller and Edward Rebar to develop high-throughput sequencing assays to map potential off-target genomic sites for *de novo* engineered zinc finger and TALE nucleases. The first papers applying
    CRISPR-Cas9 editing in human cells were published around when I was leaving Sangamo, and the perspective I gained working for some of the first people to develop genome-editing reagents has been invaluable as CRISPR has
    quickly become a default molecular biological tool.

    I then moved to Seattle, where I completed my Ph.D. in Genome Sciences in Jay Shendure's lab. In Jay's lab, I first developed new molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I developed RNA Proximity Ligation, a high-throughput method
    to resolve RNA structures transcriptome-wide using proximity ligation and sequencing. I then worked with Andrew Adey, Junyue Cao, Darren Cusanovich, and a bunch of other incredibly talented scientists
    to co-develop single-cell combinatorial indexing--a methodological strategy to molecularly tag intact cells and nuclei with DNA barcodes to make genome-wide biochemical measurements in thousands of single-cells in parallel,
    without ever resorting to isolating individual cells or nuclei. This indexing paradigm, termed "sci" for short, is just one of a few novel molecular approaches that will power my lab's approach to studying gene reguatory questions.

    In the Fall of 2018, I will be starting my own group at UC San Francisco. Our overarching goal will be to continue developing novel molecular methods to study gene regulatory phenomena across the central dogma!"
