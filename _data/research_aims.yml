  description: 'We harness the DNA editing capabilities of various enzymes to diversify the mammalian genome in a targeted manner with high specificity and efficiency.
  We have rencetly developed TRACE (T7 polymerase-driven continuous editing), a system which enables continuous, targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotic cells with 
  a wide editing window (at least 2000 bp) and no deletions in nucleotide sequences. TRACE combines the DNA processivity of bacteriophage DNA-dependent T7 RNA polymerases 
  with the somatic hypermutation capability of cytidine deaminases and can thus continuously diversify DNA nucleotides downstream of a T7 promoter.
  
  
  We are now employing TRACE to 1) diversify endogenous gene loci in a high-throughput fashion; and 2) record temporal information such as cell lineage information *in vivo*. 
  We are also interested in combining temporal information with other cellular modalities.

  description: 'Spermatogenesis - the biological process of sperm production - takes place in the spatially confined environment of seminiferous tubules and is constantly 
  influenced by the somatic cell types in the peritubular and interstitial space. However, there has been a lack of tools to comprehensively profile spermatogenesis within 
  the native context of seminiferous tubules. Using a high throughput spatial profiling method called [Slide-seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1219), we have recently generated the first unbiased spatial transcriptome 
  atlas for the mouse and human spermatogenesis at near single-cell resolution. By applying a custom computational pipeline, we were able to assign information of cell type, 
  seminiferous tubule, and stage to each Slide-seq bead with high accuracy, providing a framework to systematically evaluate the spatial dynamics in gene expressions and in cellular 
  structures both within and surrounding the seminiferous tubules with high resolution. 


  We are now pushing the limit of the current Slide-seq technology to build the next-generation spatial transcriptomics atlas for mammalian spermatogenesis. We will then use this atlas
  to solve some of the biggest misteries in male reproductive biology. In addtion, we are also interested in developing technologies which capture the epigenome (e.g., chromatin accessibility and histone modifications) in a
  spatially-resolved manner.

  description: 'A fascinating consequence of deranging the extended MYC network is the ectopic expression of tRNA genes, which are not only critical to protein synthesis, but
    may also play unexpected "moonlighting" roles in other biological processes. We use synthetic genetic perturbation (*i.e.* CRISPR/CRISPRi/CRISPRa) in
    cell lines to characterize the molecular consequences of perturbing tRNAs and tRNA-associated genes.


    In parallel, we employ high-resolution protein-DNA interaction mapping
    approaches to study redistribution of RNA polymerase III, its basal transcriptional machinery, and transcription factors in response to cellular perturbations. In this way,
    we hope to simultaneously decode the *cis* regulatory features responsible for regulating tRNA transcription, and the systems-level consequences of dysregulated tRNA transcription
    in cells.
