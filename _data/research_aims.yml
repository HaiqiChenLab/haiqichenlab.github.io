  description: 'We invent high-throughput molecular tools to study how biology''s central dogma is regulated. We are interested in developing new ways to molecularly tag nucleic acids and proteins with unique genomic or proteomic identifiers,
    allowing us to quantify biological phenomena (*e.g.* chromatin accessibility, chromosomal structure, RNA abundance) at the level of single cells and single molecules, at high-resolution and at scale. Our ultimate goal is to leverage these techniques to better understand how
    protein-nucleic acid interactions, transcriptional dynamics, and translational dynamics vary across single cells , and how these characteristics ultimately encode cellular phenotype.
