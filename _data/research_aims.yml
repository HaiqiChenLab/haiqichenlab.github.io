  description: 'We invent high-throughput molecular tools to study how biology''s central dogma is regulated. We are particularly interested in devising ways to molecularly tag nucleic acids and proteins with unique genomic or proteomic identifiers,
    allowing us to quantify biological phenomena (*e.g.* chromatin accessibility, chromosomal structure, RNA abundance, protein synthesis rates) at the level of single cells and single molecules, using high-throughput sequencing and cutting-edge mass spectrometric techniques.
    Our ultimate goal is to combine these techniques with synthetic, metabolic, and genetic cellular perturbations, to better understand how
    protein-nucleic acid interactions, transcriptional dynamics, and translational dynamics vary in the face of diverse cellular inputs, and how these phenomena ultimately encode cellular phenotype.

  description: 'Cellular and organismal functions in the contexts of development and disease
    rely on the integration of extracellular signals into gene regulatory responses across the
    central dogma of biology. We apply metabolic perturbation strategies to established cell culture
    systems, and use a diverse array of genomic techniques, including high-throughput single-cell sequencing techniques (*e.g.* sci-RNA-seq, sci-ATAC-seq) and high-throughput protein-DNA mapping techniques (*e.g.* ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN) to characterize the molecular consequences of these perturbations.


    We are particularly interested in the role of the extended MYC network of transcription factors
    as transcriptional "integrators" of cellular metabolism, and collaborate with [Bob Eisenman''s lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/eisenman/en.html) at
    the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to apply our tools to diverse *in vitro* and *in vivo* models
    for MYC network dysregulation. Ultimately, we aim to define the processes by which cells normally relate metabolic state to specific
    transcriptional programs, and better understand how these programs go awry in diseases like cancer.

  description: 'A fascinating consequence of deranging the extended MYC network is the ectopic expression of tRNA genes. We use synthetic genetic perturbation (*i.e.* CRISPR/CRISPRi/CRISPRa) in
    cell lines to characterize the molecular consequences of perturbing tRNAs and tRNA-associated genes.
