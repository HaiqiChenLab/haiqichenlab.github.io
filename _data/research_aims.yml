  description: 'We invent high-throughput molecular tools to study how biology''s central dogma is regulated. We devise novel ways to molecularly tag nucleic acids and proteins with unique genomic or proteomic identifiers,
    which we then use to quantify biological phenomena at the level of single cells and single-molecules at high-resolution and scale. Our ultimate goal is to leverage these techniques to better understand how
    protein-nucleic acid interactions, transcriptional dynamics, and small RNA abundances vary *in vivo* in thousands of single cells in parallel. We are also leveraging cutting-edge mass spectrometric techniques to carry out high-throughput proteomic
    biochemistry, and extend massively parallel measurement to study gene regulation at the level of protein.
