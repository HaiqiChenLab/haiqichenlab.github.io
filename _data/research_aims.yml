  # description: 'We develop high-throughput tools to study how biology''s central dogma is regulated. Many of the methods we develop and employ
  #   employ molecular biology to tag nucleic acids and proteins with unique genomic or proteomic identifiers, which we then use to quantify biological phenomena at the level of single
  #   cells and single-molecules at high-resolution and scale. To this end, we are employing strategies like single-cell combinatorial indexing ("sci" sequencing) to label DNA and RNA, to measure
  #   protein-nucleic acid interactions, transcriptional dynamics, and small RNA abundances *in vivo* in thousands of single cells in parallel. We are also leveraging cutting-edge mass spectrometric techniques to carry out high-throughput proteomic
  #   biochemistry, and extend massively parallel measurement to study gene regulation at the level of protein.

#     I then moved to Seattle, where I completed my Ph.D. in Genome Sciences in Jay Shendure''s lab. In Jay''s lab, I first developed new molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I developed RNA Proximity Ligation, a high-throughput method
#     to resolve RNA structures transcriptome-wide using proximity ligation and sequencing. I then worked with Andrew Adey, Junyue Cao, Darren Cusanovich, and a bunch of other incredibly talented scientists
#     to co-develop single-cell combinatorial indexing--a methodological strategy to molecularly tag intact cells and nuclei with DNA barcodes to make genome-wide biochemical measurements in thousands of single-cells in parallel,
#     without ever resorting to isolating individual cells or nuclei. This indexing paradigm, termed "sci" for short, is just one of a few novel molecular approaches that will power my lab's approach to studying gene reguatory questions.
#
#     In the Fall of 2018, I will be starting my own group at UC San Francisco. Our overarching goal will be to continue developing novel molecular methods to study gene regulatory phenomena across the central dogma!'
