This lab website uses Beautiful-Jekyll as a base, and then has elements hacked together from several sources, including the [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/), the [Fraser Lab](http://fraserlab.com/), and UW Sampa's [research group](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web) template. Thanks to those who made their website source public / allowed me to borrow snippets of code!
